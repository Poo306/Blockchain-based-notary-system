Blockchain Notary

**Blockchain Notary** is a minimal, logical, and practical decentralized application (DApp) that uses smart contracts on Ethereum to **notarize any digital document hash securely and immutably**.

Concept

Traditionally, to prove ownership of a document at a specific point in time, youâ€™d visit a **notary public**. But now, you can do the same using **blockchain technology** â€” cheaper, faster, and globally verifiable.

This DApp **registers a unique cryptographic hash** of your document onto the blockchain â€” meaning:

- No document is ever uploaded or shared
- Only a **SHA-256 hash** of the file is stored
- Anyone can later verify the documentâ€™s authenticity
- The data is immutable and permanent

---

How It Works

1. A user selects a document (e.g., PDF, image).
2. The app computes its **SHA-256 hash**.
3. That hash is submitted to the **Notarise smart contract**.
4. The contract logs the `msg.sender` and `timestamp`.
5. The file hash can be queried anytime to verify ownership and time.

Technologies Used

- **Solidity** â€” for the Notarise smart contract  
- **Hardhat** â€” development and testing framework  
- **Ganache** or **Hardhat Network** â€” local blockchain simulation  
- **Node.js & Ethers.js** â€” for backend scripting  
- (Optional) HTML/JS frontend
